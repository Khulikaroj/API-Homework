For FinTech Boot Camp
I wrote Financial Report in a markdown file named "financial_planner_report". You can find calculation I refer to in Budget Analysis and Retirement plan in these followinf files; "account_summary" and "portfolio_planner". 
In portfolio planner analysis, I assume 30 years of living after retirement for calculating withdrawal amount per year to make more sense when compare to salary before retirement.
